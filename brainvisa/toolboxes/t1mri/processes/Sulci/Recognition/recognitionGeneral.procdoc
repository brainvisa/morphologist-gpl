There is an even more general version, for both hemishperes, called <a href="bvprocess://recognitionGeneralBoth">Sulci Recognition (2 hemispheres)</a>.

<ul>
  <li>the default mode has been set to "SPAM", if the corresponding model has been installed and is found.
  </li>
  <li>The ANN default models are the newer 2011 one, which follow the same nomenclature and learning database as the SPAM models, but slightly differ from the older 2000-2001 models.

</p>
<p>Sulci are identified according to a model. The current models are based on a nomenclature which is described <a href="http://lnao.fr/spip.php?article229">here, on the LNAO lab website</a>, and a probabilistic atlas of the sulci is also provided there.
